# IAM Access Reviewer & Compliance Auditor

## Overview

The **IAM Access Reviewer & Compliance Auditor** is a security automation tool that simplifies **user access reviews** and ensures **compliance with industry standards** such as **PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP**. It provides structured IAM audits across **AWS IAM, ForgeRock, and LDAP environments**, detecting excessive permissions, inactive accounts, and security misconfigurations.

This project demonstrates a **real-world enterprise IAM security solution**, aligning with **Visa‚Äôs security automation needs** and showcasing expertise in **IAM governance, compliance enforcement, and security engineering**.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Provider Support** ‚Äì Integrates with **AWS IAM (real implementation)** and simulates **ForgeRock & LDAP** to demonstrate cross-platform IAM security automation.
- **Automated IAM Audits** ‚Äì Identifies **excessive privileges, missing MFA, and inactive accounts** to mitigate security risks.
- **Regulatory Compliance Enforcement** ‚Äì Validates IAM configurations against **PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and least privilege policies**.
- **Comprehensive Reporting** ‚Äì Generates **structured audit reports** with **severity levels and remediation recommendations**.
- **CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions** ‚Äì Automates IAM security audits on every commit, ensuring **continuous compliance monitoring**.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ‚Äì Uses **Pytest-based unit tests** to maintain audit accuracy and ensure code reliability.

## How It Works

1. **Collects IAM user data** from **AWS, ForgeRock, or LDAP**.
2. **Analyzes permissions and access levels** to detect **overprivileged users and inactive accounts**.
3. **Performs compliance checks** based on **PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and least privilege policies**.
4. **Generates a structured IAM audit report** detailing security risks and recommended remediation actions.
5. **Runs continuously via GitHub Actions**, ensuring that IAM security remains **up-to-date and aligned with compliance frameworks**.

## GitHub Actions Integration

This project is fully **automated** using **GitHub Actions**, enabling a streamlined IAM audit pipeline. Every **code commit** automatically triggers:

- **Unit Testing with Pytest** ‚Äì Ensures compliance validation accuracy.
- **IAM Audit Execution** ‚Äì Fetches user data and applies IAM security checks.
- **Audit Report Generation & Upload** ‚Äì Stores security reports as artifacts for review.

By leveraging **CI/CD best practices**, this automation reduces **manual IAM security overhead** and provides **real-time compliance enforcement**.

## Installation & Usage

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ginosettecasi/iam-access-reviewer.git
cd iam-access-reviewer
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run an IAM Audit**
- **For AWS IAM (Requires AWS Credentials):**
  ```bash
  python iam_audit.py --provider aws
  ```
- **For Simulated ForgeRock:**
  ```bash
  python iam_audit.py --provider forgerock
  ```
- **For Simulated LDAP:**
  ```bash
  python iam_audit.py --provider ldap
  ```

### **4. View Audit Reports**
The tool generates an IAM security audit report in the `reports/` directory:
```bash
cat reports/iam_report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt
```
